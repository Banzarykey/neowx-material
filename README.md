## Contribution

Feel free to add your own improvements. Contributions are always welcome!

Our previous skin, NeoWX, was used all over the world in many countries.
We hope that this skin will do the same. Please consider translating our skin 
in your language.

## Thank You!

This config and some parts of the skin are based on the template code      
of the original "Standard" skin of weewx. Many thanks to Tom Keffer and     
the weewx contributors. One of the best solutions for your weather station under linux!

The design is based on [Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) Free](https://mdbootstrap.com).

NOAA reports and some parts of the configuration are based on the Standard weewx skin.

## TODO

- Assets cleanup
